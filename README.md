- 👋 Hi, I'm @rafaellef and I started my journey to become a web developer in 2021.
  
  I am a self-taught person who likes to solve problems. If I had to describe myself in two words I would say I am curious and analytical. 
  My main philosophy in life is based on critical thinking and prudence, without neglecting the search for adventures in new ways.

- 👀 I'm interested in new ideas, philosophy, technology, politics, music, books, travel and who knows what else...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects.
- 📫 To contact me add me on LinkedIn and leave your message and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
